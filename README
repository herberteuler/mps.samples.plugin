This is a no-frills sample to show how to create a plugin to read a file
into a solution. There are no checks or other se sugar, just the bare file
reading.

This sample shows:
* Creation of a plugin which registeres in Tools menu
* Import of a csv file into a solution (using a Swing FileChooser)
* csv file generation with gtext

Note: For mass node edit/create you should switch to loading mode
before and back to the old mode after modifying the model as discussed
in http://www.jetbrains.net/devnet/thread/283794?tstart=0

Usage
-----
* Open in MPS
* Open the MyCrowd sandbox solution
* (You may play with the sandbox solution MyCrowd - add and remove lines)
* Select in menu Tools/MyGroup/Import Crowd
* Choose a file, e.g. the persons.csv from project root
* All old lines should be removed and the line from csv file should be
  displayed
* You may generate csv files again from the model
